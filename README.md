# RL final project


## Lemeng Wu and Xing Han

This code is based on this [repo](https://github.com/ikostrikov/pytorch-a2c-ppo-acktr-gail), we add the splitting part and test it on HALF-Cheetah-v2 enviornment.

To run the small size baseline with seed i, run
```bash
bash run1.sh i
```

To run the splitting method with seed i, run
```bash
bash run2.sh i
```

To run the large size baseline with seed i, run
```bash
bash run3.sh i
```

To run the random splitting baseline with seed i, run
```bash
bash run44.sh i
```

i here could be any integer, the best result are seed = 1 in our report.
